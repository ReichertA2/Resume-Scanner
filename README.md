## About the App

The Resume Scanner application has login and registration authentication that 
allows users to edit their profiles. This application provides users with the 
ability to scan their resumes against multiple job descriptions to get the 
top 10 missing keywords. User can then update their resume 
to better match the job description to increase their chances of getting
through the applicant tracking system when applying to jobs.
